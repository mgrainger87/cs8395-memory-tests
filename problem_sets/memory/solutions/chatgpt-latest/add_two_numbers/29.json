    "solution_code": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, to the heads of `l1` and `l2` respectively.\n2. Initialize a carry variable, `carry`, to 0.\n3. Initialize an empty list, `result`, to store the sum of the two numbers.\n4. While `p1` or `p2` is not None:\n   - Initialize `x` to the value of `p1` if `p1` is not None, otherwise set `x` to 0.\n   - Initialize `y` to the value of `p2` if `p2` is not None, otherwise set `y` to 0.\n   - Compute the sum of `x`, `y`, and `carry` and store it in a variable, `sum`.\n   - Determine the value of the carry for the next iteration by dividing `sum` by 10 and storing it in `carry`.\n   - Append the remainder of `sum` (i.e. `sum % 10`) to `result`.\n   - Move `p1` and `p2` to the next nodes if they are not None.\n5. If `carry` is greater than 0, append `carry` to `result`.\n6. Return `result`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of `l1` and `l2` respectively, because we need to iterate through both lists to compute the sum. The space complexity is O(max(n, m)) as well, because the length of the result can be at most max(n, m) + 1.",
