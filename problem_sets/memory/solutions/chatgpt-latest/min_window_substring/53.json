    "solution_code": "The problem can be solved using the sliding window technique. We can use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to create a window in the string `s`. We will move the `right` pointer to expand the window until we find a window that contains all the characters from string `t`. Then, we will move the `left` pointer to shrink the window, keeping track of the minimum window that contains all the characters from `t`. We will continue this process until we have considered all the characters in `s`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. Initialize variables `left` and `right` to 0.\n2. Create two dictionaries, `target` and `window`, to store the frequency of characters in string `t` and the current window, respectively.\n3. Initialize a variable `match_count` to 0, which represents the number of characters in the current window that match the characters in `t`.\n4. Initialize a variable `min_length` to a large number and an empty string `min_window` to store the minimum window that contains all the characters from `t`.\n5. Iterate over the characters in string `t` and update the `target` dictionary with the frequency of each character.\n6. Start a while loop with the condition `right < len(s)`.\n   - Check if the character at index `right` in `s` is present in the `target` dictionary.\n     - If it is present, update the `window` dictionary with the frequency of the character and increment `match_count` by 1.\n   - Check if `match_count` is equal to the length of string `t`.\n     - If it is, we have found a window that contains all the characters from `t`.\n       - Check if the length of the current window is smaller than `min_length`.\n         - If it is, update `min_length` with the length of the current window and update `min_window` with the substring from `left` to `right + 1`.\n       - Remove the character at index `left` from the `window` dictionary and decrement its frequency.\n       - Increment `left` by 1 and decrement `match_count` by 1.\n   - Increment `right` by 1.\n7. Return `min_window`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above approach:",
