Initialize a dictionary `char_counts` to store the count of each character in the string 'text'.\n2. Initialize a variable `min_instances` to infinity.\n3. Iterate through each character in the string 'text':\n     - If the character is 'b', 'a', 'l', 'o', or 'n', increment the count of that character in the `char_counts` dictionary.\n4. Iterate through each character in the string 'balloon':\n     - If the character is 'b', 'a', 'l', or 'n', calculate the minimum number of instances of that character that can be formed using the count of that character in the `char_counts` dictionary, and update the value of `min_instances` accordingly.\n     - If the character is 'o', calculate the minimum number of instances of that character that can be formed using half the count of that character in the `char_counts` dictionary, and update the value of `min_instances` accordingly.\n5. Return the value of `min_instances`.\n\n# Complexity Analysis\n\nThe time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the string 'text'. This is because we need to iterate through each character in the string 'text' twice: once to calculate the count of each character in the `char_counts` dictionary, and once to calculate the minimum number of instances of each character that can be formed.\n\nThe space complexity for this approach is O(1) because the size of the `char_counts` dictionary is fixed and does not depend on the size of the input.",
