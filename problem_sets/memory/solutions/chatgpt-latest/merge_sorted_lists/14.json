    "solution_code": "The problem is asking us to merge two sorted lists into a new sorted list.\n\nTo solve the problem, we can follow these steps:\n- Initialize two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, to the start of `list1` and `list2` respectively.\n- Initialize an empty list, `result`, to store the merged sorted list.\n- While both `p1` and `p2` are within the range of their respective lists:\n  - If the element at `p1` in `list1` is less than or equal to the element at `p2` in `list2`, append the element at `p1` to `result` and increment `p1` by 1.\n  - Otherwise, append the element at `p2` to `result` and increment `p2` by 1.\n- After the loop, if there are any remaining elements in `list1`, append them to `result`.\n- After the loop, if there are any remaining elements in `list2`, append them to `result`.\n- Return the `result` list as the merged sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this solution in the `merge_sorted_lists` function.",
