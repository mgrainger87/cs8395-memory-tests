    "solution_code": "### Approach\n\nTo determine if a string is valid, we can use a stack data structure. \n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate through each character in the string.\n3. If the character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), push it onto the stack.\n4. If the character is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False since there is no corresponding opening bracket. Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the closing bracket. If it doesn't, return False.\n5. After iterating through all characters in the string, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n\nSince we iterate through each character in the string once and perform constant time operations (pushing and popping from the stack), the time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n) since the worst case scenario is that all characters in the string are opening brackets and they are all pushed onto the stack.",
