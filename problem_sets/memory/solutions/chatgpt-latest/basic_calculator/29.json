Initialize two variables, `result` and `num`, to keep track of the current result and the current number being processed.\n2. Initialize a variable `operator` to keep track of the current operator.\n3. Iterate through each character in the input string `s`:\n   - If the character is a digit, update `num` by multiplying it by 10 and adding the integer value of the current digit.\n   - If the character is an operator or we have reached the end of the string, perform the operation based on the current operator:\n     - If `operator` is '+', add `num` to `result`.\n     - If `operator` is '-', subtract `num` from `result`.\n     - If `operator` is '*', multiply `result` by `num`.\n     - If `operator` is '/', divide `result` by `num` using integer division.\n     - Update `num` to 0 and `operator` to the current character.\n4. Return the final value of `result`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this solution:",
