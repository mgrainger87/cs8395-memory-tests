    "solution_code": "To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We start with two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start of the string S. We also maintain a variable called min_length to track the minimum length of the window that contains all characters in T.\n\nWe iterate through the string S using the right pointer. For each character, if it matches the current character in T, we move the right pointer forward. If the right pointer reaches the end of T, it means we have found a window that contains all characters in T.\n\nNow, we try to minimize the window by moving the left pointer forward until we no longer have a valid window (i.e., the window no longer contains all characters in T). At each step, we update the min_length if the current window is smaller than the previous minimum length.\n\nFinally, we return the substring of S from the left pointer to the left pointer + min_length.\n\nHere is the implementation in Python:\n\ndef minimum_window_subsequence(S: str, T: str) -> str:\n    left = 0\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    result = ''\n    \n    while left < len(S):\n        # Initialize right pointer and T_index\n        right = left\n        T_index = 0\n        \n        # Find the window that contains all characters in T\n        while right < len(S):\n            if S[right] == T[T_index]:\n                T_index += 1\n                if T_index == len(T):\n                    break\n            right += 1\n        \n        # If the window is valid, update min_length and result\n        if T_index == len(T) and right - left + 1 < min_length:\n            min_length = right - left + 1\n            result = S[left:right+1]\n        \n        # Move the left pointer forward\n        left += 1\n    \n    return result\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string S.",
