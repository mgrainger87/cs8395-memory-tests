    "solution_code": "To count the number of palindromic substrings in a given string, we can use the concept of expanding around the center. \n\nThe idea is to iterate through each character in the string and treat it as the center of a potential palindrome. We can then expand outwards from the center and check if the substring formed is a palindrome. If it is, we increment our count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\ndef count_substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    # Helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome\n    def is_palindrome(start, end):\n        while start < end:\n            if s[start] != s[end]:\n                return False\n            start += 1\n            end -= 1\n        return True\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Expand around the center for odd-length palindromes\n        left = right = i\n        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:\n            count += 1\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        \n        # Expand around the center for even-length palindromes\n        left = i\n        right = i + 1\n        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:\n            count += 1\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n    \n    return count\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through each character in the string and for each character, we expand around the center in both directions.",
