    "solution_code": "To find the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal, we can use dynamic programming. \n\nLet's define a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make the substring s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-1] equal.\n\nThe base case would be when either s1 or s2 is an empty string. In this case, the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters would be the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the non-empty string.\n\nFor the general case, we can consider the last characters of s1 and s2:\n- If the last characters are equal, then we can ignore them and the minimum ASCII sum would be the same as dp[i-1][j-1].\n- If the last characters are not equal, then we have two options:\n  - Delete the last character of s1 and find the minimum ASCII sum for s1[0...i-2] and s2[0...j-1]. This would be dp[i-1][j] + ASCII value of s1[i-1].\n  - Delete the last character of s2 and find the minimum ASCII sum for s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-2]. This would be dp[i][j-1] + ASCII value of s2[j-1].\n\nWe can iterate over the lengths of s1 and s2 to fill the dp array. Finally, the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make s1 and s2 equal would be dp[len(s1)][len(s2)].\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\ndef minimumDeleteSum(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:\n    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]\n\n    # Base cases\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + ord(s1[i-1])\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1])\n\n    # Fill dp array\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + ord(s1[i-1]), dp[i][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1]))\n\n    return dp[m][n]",
