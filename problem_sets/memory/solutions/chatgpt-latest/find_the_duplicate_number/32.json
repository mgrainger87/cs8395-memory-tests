    "solution_code": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of a linked list cycle. We can treat the array as a linked list where the value of each element represents the next index to visit. Since there is only one duplicate number, there will be a cycle in the linked list.\n\nFirst, we initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the first element of the array. We then move slow one step at a time and fast two steps at a time. Eventually, they will meet at a certain index within the cycle.\n\nNext, we reset the slow pointer to the first element and keep the fast pointer at the meeting point. We then move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point will be the duplicate number.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement this approach:\n\ndef find_duplicate(nums):\n    slow = nums[0]\n    fast = nums[0]\n    \n    # Move slow and fast pointers to find the meeting point\n    while True:\n        slow = nums[slow]\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]]\n        if slow == fast:\n            break\n    \n    # Reset slow to the first element and move both pointers one step at a time\n    slow = nums[0]\n    while slow != fast:\n        slow = nums[slow]\n        fast = nums[fast]\n    \n    # Return the duplicate number\n    return slow\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).",
