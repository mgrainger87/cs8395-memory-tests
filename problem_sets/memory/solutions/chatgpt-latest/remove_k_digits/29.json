Iterate through each digit in the input string num.\n3. For each digit, compare it with the top element of the stack. If the current digit is smaller than the top element of the stack and we still have remaining digits to remove (k > 0), pop the top element from the stack and decrement k by 1.\n4. After the iteration, if there are still remaining digits to remove (k > 0), pop the top element from the stack k times.\n5. Construct the smallest number by converting the elements in the stack to a string and reversing it.\n6. Remove any leading zeros from the smallest number.\n7. Return the smallest number.\n\n# Time Complexity Analysis\n\nThe time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input string num. This is because we iterate through each digit once.",
