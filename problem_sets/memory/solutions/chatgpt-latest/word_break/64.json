    "solution_code": "To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We create a dp array of size n+1, where n is the length of the input string s. Each element in the dp array represents whether the substring from index 0 to i-1 (inclusive) can be segmented into words in the dictionary.\n\nInitially, we set dp[0] to True, since an empty string can be segmented into an empty sequence of words.\n\nThen, for each index i from 1 to n, we check if the substring from index 0 to i-1 (inclusive) can be segmented into words in the dictionary. To do this, we iterate through all possible positions j from 0 to i-1, and check if dp[j] is True (meaning the substring from index 0 to j-1 can be segmented) and the substring from index j to i-1 is in the dictionary. If both conditions are true, we set dp[i] to True.\n\nFinally, we return the value of dp[n], which represents whether the whole string s can be segmented into words in the dictionary.\n\nHere is the implementation in Python:\n\ndef word_break(s: str, word_dict: List[str]) -> bool:\n    n = len(s)\n    dp = [False] * (n+1)\n    dp[0] = True\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_dict:\n                dp[i] = True\n                break\n\n    return dp[n]",
