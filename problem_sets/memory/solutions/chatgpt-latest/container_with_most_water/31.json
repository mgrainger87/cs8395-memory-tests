    "solution_code": "The problem is asking us to find the maximum area between two vertical lines in a given list of heights.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the two-pointer approach. We will initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the list (left pointer) and one at the end of the list (right pointer). \n\nWe can calculate the area between the two pointers using the formula: area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left). This formula calculates the area between the two pointers by taking the minimum height between the two pointers and multiplying it by the distance between the two pointers.\n\nWe will keep track of the maximum area seen so far and update it whenever we find a larger area. \n\nNext, we will move the pointer that corresponds to the shorter height towards the other pointer, as moving the pointer that corresponds to the taller height will not increase the area. This is because the width between the pointers will always decrease, and the height will stay the same or decrease.\n\nWe will continue this process until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer. At this point, we would have checked all possible pairs of vertical lines and found the maximum area.\n\nHere is the implementation in Python:\n\ndef max_area(height: List[int]) -> int:\n    left = 0\n    right = len(height) - 1\n    max_area = 0\n    \n    while left < right:\n        area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)\n        max_area = max(max_area, area)\n        \n        if height[left] < height[right]:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    \n    return max_area\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.",
